# SeisVis - Seismic Data Visualization Library


A simple and easy-to-use Python library for seismic data visualization, designed for geophysicists and seismic data analysts.

The motivation behind developing **seisvis** is to **reduce repetitive plotting code during paper writing** and to **enable customized figure generation directly in Python**. With SeisVis, users can create high-quality static plots in their preferred style **without the need to open and manipulate data in heavy software platforms**.
